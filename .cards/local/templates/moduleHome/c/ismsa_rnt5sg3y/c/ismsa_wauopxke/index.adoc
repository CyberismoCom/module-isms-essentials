Incident are managed according to Incident Management Process. #TODO add link to relevant process#

New incidents are recorded using incident-template that contains four cards:

* Incident - This is for incident description and analysis.

* Incident Response - This is a subtask for documenting containment, eradication and recovery actions.

* Incident Communication: This is a subtask for documenting incident communication towards authorities, customers, other external parties and internally.

* Post-incident actions: This is a subtask for documenting lessons learned and other post-incident activities.

*Note*: If incident contains CONFIDENTIAL information, it can be stored at separately selected location (e.g. Teams) with limited access. Link to material is added to incidents that are recorded here.
