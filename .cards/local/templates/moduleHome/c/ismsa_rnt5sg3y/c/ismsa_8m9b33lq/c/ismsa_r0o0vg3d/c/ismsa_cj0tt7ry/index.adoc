## Devices

Devices that support primary assets. In additions to fields (such as owner or criticality) that are mandatory for all assets, following characteristics need to be defined for devices:

* Access Control

* Vulnerability and patch management

* Backups

{{{createCards '{
    "template": "ismsa/templates/assetDevice",
    "buttonLabel": "Add new device"
}'}}}

**Note**: If devices are already listed in some other asset register, add new category and
add there a link to the original asset register containing needed information.
