## Information systems

Information systems support primary assets. In additions to fields (such as owner or criticality) that are mandatory for all assets, following characteristics need to be defined for information systems:

* Access controls attributes (AD/local accounts, accessibility from public networks, MFA)

* Responsibility for security updates

* Backups

* Level of logging

* Level of monitoring

    "template": "ismsa/templates/assetInformationSystem",
    "buttonLabel": "Add new information system"
}'}}}

**Note**: If information systems are already stored in some other asset register, just add link here and ensure original 
asset register contains needed information.
